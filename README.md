## Introduction

The FVessel benchmark dataset is used to evaluate the reliability of AIS and video data fusion algorithms, which mainly contains 26 videos and corresponding AIS data captured by HIKVISION DS-2DC4423IW-D dome camera and Saiyang AIS9000-08 Class-B AIS receiver on the Wuhan Segment of the Yangtze. Since the Maritime Mobile Service Identity (MMSI) contains AIS data reveals the vessel identity, we replaced it with a random number. As shown in Fig. 1, these videos were captured under many locations (e.g., bridge region and riverside) and various weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, and low-light).
